Employent Application Review System (EARS)

About the System
EARS is an intranet-based Employment Application Review System. The system is designed so that school faculty members can review applicants and collaborate asynchronously in order to find the best applicant for a given job opening. This system reduces the overhead of the process and lightens the workload for the search chairperson.
